# System Administration Bash Scripts

## Description
This repository contains three shell scripts I created for my Systems Programming class at Trent University.
As well as whatever I have wrote that I thought was useful/cool since then

## Purpose
These scripts are meant to be used in a system administration context. They each will look through log files in order to find the largest offenders in unauthorized access attempts to a Unix system. 

**sortip.sh** will find the ip address with the most attempts, and get the geolocation of them

**getfailedinvaliduser.sh** and getfailedvaliduser.sh search for either valid or invalid username attempts at logging into the server.

**helloThere.sh** is mostly just an in joke for Revenge of the Sith fans :)

**installDocker.sh** was something I wrote after following the install instructions for the upteenth time

**createUsers.sh** Is a script I wrote for a lab while I was taking the ACloudGuru Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Course. This script takes usernames as input, and will create them with a default password.

**deleteUsers.sh** Is the same as above, but deletes a user and their home dir  instead of creating
## What I learned
- BASH scripting
- Common Unix/Linux shell commands
