# System Administration Bash Scripts

## Description
This repository contains three shell scripts I created for my Systems Programming class at Trent University.

## Purpose
These scripts are meant to be used in a system administration context. They each will look through log files in order to find the largest offenders in unauthorized access attempts to a Unix system. 

sortip.sh will find the ip address with the most attempts, and get the geolocation of them

getfailedinvaliduser.sh and getfailedvaliduser.sh search for either valid or invalid username attempts at logging into the server.


## What I learned
- BASH scripting
- Common Unix/Linux shell commands
